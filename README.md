# book_tracker_API
A simple book tracker API using Node.js and Express that supports CRUD operations. 
Book Tracker API Project

 Goal;
Build a simple Book Tracker API using Node.js and Express that supports CRUD operations.

 Project Requirements
Each book should have:

- id (number)
- title (string)
- author (string)
- year (number)
- completed (boolean, whether the book was read or not)

Example:

{
 "id": 1,
 "title": "Atomic Habits",
 "author": "James Clear",
 "year": 2018,
 "completed": false
}

### API Endpoints
1. GET /books → Get all books
2. GET /books/:id → Get book by ID
3. POST /books → Add a new book
4. PUT /books/:id → Update a book
5. DELETE /books/:id → Delete a book

Example Implementation (In-Memory)

const express = require('express');
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

let books = [
 { id: 1, title: "Atomic Habits", author: "James Clear", year: 2018, completed: false },
 { id: 2, title: "Clean Code", author: "Robert C. Martin", year: 2008, completed: true }
];

app.get('/books', (req, res) => {
 res.json({ success: true, data: books });
});

app.get('/books/:id', (req, res) => {
 const id = parseInt(req.params.id);
 const book = books.find(b => b.id === id);
 if (!book) return res.status(404).json({ success: false, message: "Book not found" });
 res.json({ success: true, data: book });
});

app.post('/books', (req, res) => {
 const { title, author, year } = req.body;
 if (!title || !author || !year) {
   return res.status(400).json({ success: false, message: "All fields are required" });
 }
 const newBook = { id: books.length + 1, title, author, year, completed: false };
 books.push(newBook);
 res.status(201).json({ success: true, data: newBook });
});


const PORT = 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(Book Tracker API running on http://localhost:${PORT}));

Assignment;
1. Add a GET /books/completed endpoint → returns only completed books.
2. Add validation so a book’s year must be greater than 1900.
3. Add a search feature → GET /books/search?title=atomic should return books matching the word.
4. Add a createdAt field when a book is added.
5. Add a PUT /books/:id endpoint → edits a book by the ID and returns a response whether the operation was successful or not.
6. Add a DELETE /books/:id endpoint → Delete’s a book by the ID and returns a response whether the operation was successful or not.
7. (Optional) Use SQLite instead of in-memory storage to persist data.
